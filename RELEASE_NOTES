Carrier Lookup Account Issues
The Ez Texting service has a slight caveat for usage of the carrier lookup command. Unfortunately the account system is setup so that 
you must have one account for the Carrier lookup API command and another for all other commands. To use this gem with respect to this
issue you need to swap the accounts (calling the EztextingRest.connect! method) when using the carrier lookup command and then swap 
if back to your account for the rest of the API when you use those commands

Example
---------------------------------------------------------
1) Cache your credentials for your account for the API 

# Account for API usage (except carrier lookup)
EztextingRest.connect!(username_for_api_without_carrier,password)
# => "credentials cached"  

2) Use as you wish for all commands except the carrier lookup
options = {
  'PhoneNumbers[1]'=>'5551239988', 
  'Subject'=>'Check it out', 
  'Message'=>'I am making an awesome application with this api!'
}
EztextingRest::Sms.single(options)
# => [201, "Success - A new message has been scheduled for delivery", "<?xm.....]

EztextingRest::Availability.check("games")
# => [200, "Success - The Keyword is available", "<?xml version=\"1.0\" e......]

3) Swap your credentials by calling the connect! method again with the different account information

EztextingRest.connect!(carrier_lookup_enabled_account,password)
# => "credentials cached


4) Call the lookup command as much as you need
EztextingRest::Lookup.carrier(5555555555)


5) When you need to use any of the other API commands change your cached credentials back to the account for the rest of the API
EztextingRest.connect!(username_for_api_without_carrier,password)
# => "credentials cached"
